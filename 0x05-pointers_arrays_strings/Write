oincludn the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters
You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number
If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0
You are not allowed to use long
You are not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array
You are not allowed to hard-code special values
We will use the -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag to compile your code.  "main.h"
#include <stdio.h>
/**
 * main - main block
 * Return: 0
 */
int main(void)
{
	int a;
	unsigned long b = 0, c = 1, d;

	for (a = 0; a < 50; a++)
	{
		d = b + c;
		printf("%lu", d);
		b = c;
		c = d;
		if (a == 49)
			printf("\n");
		else
			printf(", ");
	}
	return (0);
